# Playwright BDD

This project demonstrates how to use **Playwright** with **Cucumber (BDD)** to automate web testing. It includes sample test cases written in Gherkin and the corresponding step definitions in JavaScript. Playwright is used to launch browsers and interact with web pages, while Cucumber helps with BDD-style scenarios.
